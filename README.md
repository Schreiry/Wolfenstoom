<p align="center">  I'll start with a rambling rant. . . . . </p>

My age does not allow me to fully appreciate the past, the distant past, which does not belong to me,
but I admire John Carmack and John Romero, they are brilliant for their time, 
perhaps the game on the component - interactivity and narrative, very weak, but as the speed of the game, gameplay, it is new for the nineties. 
I decided to combine these two games out of love for both the new and old Wolfenstein & DOOM series, and it turned out to be an even more surreal project than the creators of the original games had. However, I didn't create anything new, I'm just eager to have a new experience, to learn something new. 
I named the game as sumptuously as the rest of this project - Wolfenstoom. 

### Future Ideas :   
- Implement reloading, add mechanics like from the game - Doom, as well as from Wolfenstein ; 
- Doors on locations ;  
- Increase the location in times ;  
- Random location of ammunition, which can be raised in the aftermath of finding ; 

### One of the distinguishing features of this game, is textures with improved quality, and better rendering of the frame. ####
